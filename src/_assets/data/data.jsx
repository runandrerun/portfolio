I decided to pivot and change careers when I felt that I wasn't satisfied â€“ I quit, traveled, and returned to attend a coding bootcamp. I never looked back, and I've never been happier. In fact, my only regret is that I didn't make this career change sooner. I'm currently now looking for new opportunities in which I can continue to learn and grow into a better developer. Ideally, I'd love to be in the pet tech or health space.",
